# Face Recognition and Attendance System

This project implements a web-based attendance system using facial
recognition. Users can mark their attendance through a webcam, and 
the system identifies and records their presence.
The recorded attendance data is then exported and saved in a CSV 
file for easy access and further analysis. 
This system offers a convenient and secure method for
tracking attendance in classrooms, workplaces, or any other environment.
